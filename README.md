# concurrent transaction simulator

## Introduction
The first step of the project is to build a concurrent transaction simulator that mimics real life transaction workload of an IoT based system on a database system. The simulator should be able to create and process multithreaded transactions on multiple database systems.


## Way to implement the measurement of the workload of data when your PC is really bad!!
Priority Mailbox allows you to set the sampling be the highest priority. So set the time rate to sample the number of transactions before executing the sql sentences is possible. In this case, we sampled the number of transactions per MINUTE.
you can set whatever the time interval you like.
